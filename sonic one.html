    <h1>Sonic 1</h1>
       <p>Sonic the Hedgehog[a] is a video game series and media franchise created by the Japanese developers Yuji
       Naka, Naoto Ohshima, and Hirokazu Yasuhara for Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic
       blue hedgehog who battles the evil Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. The main Sonic the Hedgehog games
       are platformers mostly developed by Sonic Team; other games, developed by various studios, include
       spin-offs in the racing, fighting, party and sports genres. The franchise also incorporates printed
       media, animations, feature films, and merchandise.</p>

       <p> Naka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara developed the first Sonic game, released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, to
        provide Sega with a mascot to compete with Nintendo's Mario. Its success helped Sega become one of the
        leading video game companies during the fourth generation of video game consoles in the early 1990s.
        Sega Technical Institute developed the next three Sonic games, plus the spin-off Sonic Spinball (1993).
        A number of Sonic games were also developed for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear.
        After a hiatus during the unsuccessful Saturn era, the first major 3D Sonic game, Sonic Adventure, was
        released in 1998 for the Dreamcast. Sega exited the console market and shifted to third-party
        development in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation systems. Takashi 
        Iizuka has been the series' producer since 2010.</p>
        
        <p>Sonic games often have unique game mechanics and stories, they feature recurring elements such as
        the ring-based health system, level locales, and fast-paced gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic
        setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates levels that include 
        springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. Later games added a large cast of characters; some,
        such as Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, and Shadow the Hedgehog, have starred in spin-offs.
        The franchise has crossed over with other video game franchises in games such as Mario & Sonic, Sega 
        All-Stars, and Super Smash Bros.</p>

        <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the bestselling video game franchises, selling
        over 140 million units by 2016 and grossing over $5 billion as of 2014. Series sales and free-to-play
        mobile game downloads totaled 1.6 billion as of 2023. The Genesis Sonic games have been described as
        representative of the culture of the 1990s and listed among the greatest of all time. Although later 
        games, notably the 2006 game, received poorer reviews, Sonic is influential in the video game industry
        and is frequently referenced in popular culture. The franchise is known for its fandom that produces
        unofficial media, such as fan art and fangames.</p>

       <p>Sonic the Hedgehog[c] is a 1991 platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the 
       Genesis/Mega Drive. It was released in North America on June 23 and in PAL regions and Japan the following
       month. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who can run at near supersonic speeds; Sonic sets out on a
       quest to defeat Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and seeks the powerful 
       Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme,
       with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.</p>

       <p>Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the 
       company. The developers chose a blue hedgehog designed by Naoto Oshima after he won an internal character 
       design contest, and named themselves Sonic Team to match their character. It uses a novel technique that
       allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery which was based on a concept by Oshima from 1989.[2] 
       Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator
       Shigeru Miyamoto. The music was composed by Masato Nakamura, bassist of the J-pop band Dreams Come True.</p>

       <p>Sonic the Hedgehog was very well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It is 
       widely considered one of the greatest video games of all time and became one of the best-selling video
       games of all time with approximately 24 million copies sold worldwide. It established the Genesis as a 
       key player in the 16-bit era and allowed it to compete with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It has
       been ported to multiple systems and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into
       other media. It was followed by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992.</p>
